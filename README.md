# Hiority

This is the code of Android Application that offers navigation system with preemptive traffic light control called Hiority.

We have also published a conference paper of this research with the title of An IoT Application for Smart Navigation of High Priority Vehicles (HPVs) Using Preemptive Traffic-Light Control. The conference paper can be found on IEEEexplore or [click here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9297872/).
